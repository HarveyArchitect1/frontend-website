**AWS Cloud Resume Challenge**

Welcome to my AWS Cloud Resume Challenge project! This endeavor is a hands-on learning experience that aims to showcase my skills in cloud technologies, particularly within the AWS ecosystem. The challenge, created by Forrest Brazeal, serves as a practical way to demonstrate proficiency in cloud services, infrastructure as code, and serverless architecture. By undertaking this challenge, I am not only enhancing my technical capabilities but also illustrating my commitment to continuous learning and professional development as I seek to land a comparable role.
